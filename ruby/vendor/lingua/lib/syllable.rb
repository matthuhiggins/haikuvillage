module Lingua
  module EN
    # The module Lingua::EN::Syllable contains a single class method, +syllable+,
    # which will use the most accurate technique available to determine the number
    # syllables in a string containing a word passed to it.
    # The exact definition of the function depends on the availability of the
    # Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary on the system. If it is available, 
    # the number of syllables as determined by the dictionary will be returned. If
    # the dictionary is not available, or if a word not contained in the dictionary
    # is passed, it will return the number of syllables as determined by the 
    # module Lingua::EN::Syllable::Guess. For more details, see there and
    # Lingua::EN::Syllable::Dictionary.
